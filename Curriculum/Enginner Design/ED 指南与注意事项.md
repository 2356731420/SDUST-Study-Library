# 注意!!

这只是一个很糟糕的浪费时间的笔记。（浪费时间指事倍功半）
而且这个笔记很明显已经过时了。

大家随便看看就好了。

希望有人可以更新XD

### Learning Expectations and Teaching Strategies/Approach

The University’s Code of Conduct for Teaching and Learning states: 

1. Students are expected to participate actively and positively in the teaching/learning  environment. 

2. They must attend classes when and as required.

3. Strive to maintain steady  progress within the subject or unit framework,

4. comply with workload expectations

5. Submit  required work on time. 

   



## MODULE 2（工具，参考，剽窃，PCR模型，搜索信息）



### Video 1 - Tools , Referencing and Plagiarism 

> 工具，参考，剽窃  

这些东西是我们在提交作业的时候需要注意到的。

1. 我们什么时候需要引用材料？When should you reference material?

   REASON : avoid plagiarism

   分类： 1. 在文中直接给出 2. 在文章最后有一个参考列表bibliograph

2. 我们需要在我们的作业中用什么类型的资源？ What types of source should you use in your assignments?

   reliable 。 不能是blog

Some  recommend resources that you can start from

(but we also need to find your own resources)

~~~

~~~

TOOLS 

> Reference management software is something that  i would encourage all of you to start  thinking about possibly using this year .
>
> It can storing all your reference.
>
> because we need text citation and end of text referencing in our assignment

TURNITIN

It is a text-matching software which can help you to identify plagiarism.

This is an example to learn how yo read the Turnitin report:

没有参考引用，那么它就是一种抄袭

- 在某些情况下，可以引用信息，但不能引用完整的段落/段落，也不能没有适当的引号和引用。如果你引用某句话，一定要有一个很好的理由来说明为什么用自己的话来引用信息会更好
- 当您提交时，在cloudcampus查看您的提交。
- 如果你有任何问题或不确定是否有抄袭，最好问一问。

### Video 2 - Purpose Communication Response Model

目的，沟通相应模型？ 

In this video , we are going to introduce the PCR model ,  which stands(代表)  for purpose communication Response。

这是一个我们在准备需要传递信息的的时候可以用到的模型。

Object ： It is a model we can use to preparing a communication that we need to deliver .

Q1 :  我们想知道工程师需要交流什么。工程师如何沟通?

1. PCR is a model for how we can plan a communication .

2. Consumer is the person who will read or view your communication
3. Requirement in terms of the timing of when the communication is given or the formatting (格式） or the content of the communication .
4. Context  ,is this something that is face to face is it online . Delivered verbally( 口语表达)，is it an informal or formal context?

5. A gatekeeper is the person who 在把它提供给客户前，cheques the 通信包以确保它是аррrоpтаte的人。

## MODULE 3

### video 1 - Introduction to teamwork

* what a team is ?
* the life cycle of a team ？ 
* how we can deal with conflict that could arise in working in a team 

Team  - - complementary （互补的）skills 

【do your humanitarian engineering design project or electrical design project 】

 defined member roles , one of the activities that we will do is a Belbin self - perception inventory.

Life cycle 



## MODLULE 4 

### Video 1 -**Belbin team roles**

这是第一个在我们的视频 workshop teamwork

在项目进行的各个阶段，每一个角色的作用



### **Video 2 - Team goals and mission**

team mission ——它用来解释我们的题目尝试达成完成什么。

### **Video 3 - Team values and norms**

### **Video 4 - Team meeting tools and feedback**

### **Video 5 - Introduction to project management**

### **Video 6 - WBS**

### **Video 7 - Network Diagram**

### **Video 8 - Gantt chart, risk and quality**



## MODULE 5

### **Video 1 - Preparing your Gantt chart**



## MODULE 7

### **Video 1 - How might we statements**

介绍更多的关键概念which you will be applying in your humanitarian engineering design project .

1. Framing design opportunities

   don't too narrow or broad

   > when you do your humanitarian engineering design project i will get you to develop a 'how might we...' statement for your project . 

   The context of your project has been given in the design brief , your job is to turn that contxt into a ' how might we..' statement .

PRACTICE:



可以将句子上传到cloudcampus  。这是一个练习，我们可以通过它练习，以便让我们能够应用到哦我们自己的HDC （ humanltarian design challenge )中

### **Video 2 - Capacity building**(能力建设)

2. when we looking at capacity building .我们主要关注确认社区中已有的能力，并且work out 我们还需要什么能力 to build ， or develop in the community。

   当我们考虑Cb的时候，我们考虑什么能力在社区中已经有了，（这个可以在我们的DISCOVER PHASE中的得知） 并且work out 我们还需要什么能力



we can enter our information on to cloudcampus .

### **Video 3 - Community participation**

通过阅读这篇文章，我希望你们能够知道为什么考虑我们的社区如何参与进我们的设计项目这么重要。

###  

## MODULE 8

### **Video 1 - Developing Design Criteria**

we are going to applying these to your actual poject ,and the first step jere is tp uses your discover work in order tp help design criteria .

我们可以再 humanitarian engineering design brief 来选择我们的话题

WRITE :  the design project brief in he form of a design oppoertunity

Once you have confirmed your topice and written your 'how mingth we ...statement in your Online Project Workbook  we can 3

 in a more technical project we would have a specification like cost is less than 15 dollers 

但在我们的HCD项目中，相关的条件和需要都会被满足

This table is in your online project workbook ,

ACTIVITY:

function is what it can do ; features is what it has .

### **Video 2 - Using design criteria**

this video is talk about how we can use the design criteria

EXAMPLE:

there are two ideas ; drip and pump/

your ream will be coming up with many ideas but o've just included two on this table

1——5分评分划分。如果是5，那么意味着非常适合

然后求和，最大的就是可以满足我们需求的最好的方法、

ACTIVITY :
In your online project workbook ,there is a space where you and your team can talk about the approaches that you would use to evaluate your ideas against design criterai

> THE RUBRIC(规则)
>
> 1. suggest that you use a decision matrix or use SWOT analysis as well
> 2. so 通过决策矩阵确定最好的方案，再通过SWOT确定最好的方案的各种细节。

### Video 3 **- Ideate**（形成概念；想象，设想)

17 February 2021

Now we have developed your design criteria for your project 

we can move on to the ideate phases of the HDCP (human centered desgin pricess)

Now let's think about this actual ideate activity that we're gong to do 

###  



## Module 9

###  Video 1 - Introduction to engineering ethics

### Video 2 - Ethics case study activity

### Video 3 - Sustainability definitions and gapminder

### Video 4 - Sustainable Development Goals

### Video 5 - Ecological footprint

### Video 6 - Models of sustainable development and engineers role in sustainability



## MODULE 10

###  Video 1 - Local materials introduction

Discuss local materials and why we might choose to use these in our design projects.



There is a wiki available on cloudcampus where i would like you to share your thoughts on why we would choose to use local materials.

ACATITY :

share your thoughts  on the wiki .
